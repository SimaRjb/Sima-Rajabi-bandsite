# Bandsite Project

Bandsite is a fully responsive front-end application for a fictional band named 'The Bees Knees'. This project was built using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Sass for styling and visual responsiveness. It integrates dynamic data pulled from an Express API hosted on Heroku, enabling users to post comments.

## Features

- **Data Integration:** Pulls data from Heroku using Axios.
- **Dynamic Comment Section:** Utilizes JS DOM for creating and displaying comments dynamically.
- **Comment Posting:** Allows users to post comments with automatic page updates.
- **Ticket Purchase:** Enables users to purchase tickets directly through DOM manipulation.
